# 👋 Hi, I’m Sofía!
I am a Sociology graduate 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 and an enthusiast of the world of data analysis & data science 📊\
❤️‍🔥 I am passionate for _continuous learning!_\
- My **first project in Python** is about retrieving data of the **TFT game** from the **Riot Games API** and creating insights with the information provided. This is an ongoing project, which I update regularly.

**You can take a look at it [here](https://github.com/Sofia-A-Fayo-Freites/CS50-Python-Final-Project)!**
