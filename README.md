##ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m SofÃ­a! 
### I am a Sociology graduate and an enthusiast of the world of data analysis & data science.
##3# _Passion for continuous learning!_

My **first project in Python** is about retrieving data of the **TFT game** from the **Riot Games API** and creating insights with the information provided. This is an ongoing project, which I update regularly.
You can take a look at it [here](https://github.com/Sofia-A-Fayo-Freites/CS50-Python-Final-Project)!
